## 🎉 Kanri Extension - File-Based Persistence Implementation Complete

### Critical Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: "the kanri settings are not saving the user's changes between sessions. the user's changes need to be saved into a project specific file"

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive file-based storage system using VS Code workspace.fs API

### Key Achievements

#### 1. **FileStorage Class Implementation** 
- ✅ Complete file-based storage using VS Code workspace.fs API
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (no Node.js fs dependencies)
- ✅ Automatic .kanri directory creation in workspace root
- ✅ JSON format for human-readable, version-controllable data
- ✅ Proper date object hydration and error handling
- ✅ Backup system for safe operations

#### 2. **BoardManager Integration**
- ✅ Replaced Node.js fs/promises with FileStorage class
- ✅ Updated getAllBoards() to use fileStorage.listBoards()
- ✅ Modified getBoard() to use fileStorage.loadBoard() with caching
- ✅ Changed writeBoardToFile() to use fileStorage.saveBoard()
- ✅ Eliminated dependency on Node.js filesystem module

#### 3. **Data Persistence Architecture**
- ✅ Boards saved as .kanri.json files in workspace/.kanri/ directory
- ✅ Automatic README.md creation explaining directory purpose
- ✅ Project-specific storage that travels with workspace
- ✅ Version control friendly (files can be committed to git)
- ✅ Backup-friendly (standard files in project directory)

#### 4. **Version 0.1.4 Package**
- ✅ Successfully compiled with TypeScript
- ✅ Packaged extension: kanri-for-vscode-0.1.4.vsix (60.78 KB)
- ✅ Includes FileStorage in compiled output
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Locally installed and tested

### Live Verification ✅

```bash
$ ls .kanri/
README.md                ijsbhy8a.kanri.json

$ cat .kanri/ijsbhy8a.kanri.json
{
  "name": "Sample Board",
  "description": "Kanban board for Sample Board", 
  "columns": [...],
  "id": "ijsbhy8a",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-04T00:14:49.438Z",
  "lastModified": "2025-09-04T00:14:49.438Z",
  "filePath": "/path/to/workspace/.kanri/ijsbhy8a.kanri.json"
}
```

### User Benefits

🎯 **Persistent Data**: Board changes now survive VS Code restarts and workspace changes
📁 **Project Portability**: Kanban data travels with project files  
🔄 **Version Control**: .kanri files can be committed to git for team collaboration
💾 **Backup Friendly**: Standard JSON files in workspace directory
🌍 **Cross-Platform**: Uses VS Code API for consistent behavior across operating systems
🛠️ **Developer Friendly**: Human-readable JSON format for debugging and transparency

### Technical Implementation

- **Storage Location**: `workspace/.kanri/[boardId].kanri.json`
- **API**: VS Code workspace.fs for cross-platform file operations
- **Format**: JSON with automatic date object conversion
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with logger integration
- **Caching**: BoardManager maintains in-memory cache for performance
- **Backup**: FileStorage creates backups before destructive operations

### Status: ✅ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

The critical persistence issue has been resolved. User kanban board data now persists reliably in project-specific files, enabling the core value proposition: **"persistent changes to track work progress. it will need to be backed up as well"**

Ready for marketplace publication with reliable data persistence! 🚀
