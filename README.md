# Kanri for VS Code

A comprehensive VS Code extension that brings kanban board functionality directly into your development workflow. Manage tasks, track progress, and organize your work without leaving your editor.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Visual Kanban Boards**: Create and manage kanban boards with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Card Management**: Add, edit, move, and delete cards with rich metadata
- **Column Management**: Create, delete, and reorder columns to fit your workflow
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop for both cards and columns
- **Persistent Storage**: Boards are saved in your workspace's `.kanri` directory
- **Auto-save**: Changes are automatically saved as you work
- **VS Code Integration**: Fully integrated with VS Code's theming and command palette

## üéØ Inspiration

This extension was inspired by [Kanri](https://github.com/trobonox/kanri), an excellent standalone kanban application. While this VS Code extension is a completely independent implementation using TypeScript and the VS Code Extension API, we credit the original Kanri project for the inspiration and design concepts that guided this development.

**Note**: This is not a port or fork of the original Kanri software. It's a fresh implementation built specifically for VS Code using Microsoft's webview patterns and extension APIs.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This extension follows a modular architecture designed for maintainability and extensibility:

### Core Components

```

### Adding Cards
```typescript
// Command: "Kanri: Add Card to Board"

    "Done"
  ],
  "kanri.autoSave": true,
  "kanri.boardsDirectory": ".kanri",
  "kanri.enableLogging": false,
  "kanri.logLevel": "info",
  "kanri.cardColors": [
    "#ffffff",
    "#ffeb3b",

## üîÑ Extension Lifecycle

### Activation
1. Extension activated on first command execution
2. Logger initialized with current configuration
3. Board and card managers created
4. Commands registered with VS Code
5. Configuration watchers established
6. Workspace initialized for board storage

### Runtime
1. Commands execute through registered handlers
2. Managers coordinate operations
3. Configuration changes trigger updates
4. Auto-save manages persistence
5. Logging captures operations and errors

### Deactivation
1. Pending changes saved to storage
2. Resources disposed properly
3. Event listeners cleaned up
4. Extension state cleared
