Please generate a sample Git commit that includes:
A clean, modular code update (e.g. a movement system, input handler, or combat scaffold).
Inline commentary that explains each function, struct, and decision — optimized for onboarding and future extension.
A commit message that follows conventional format: short summary line, followed by detailed explanation of changes, rationale, and future considerations.
Code that is reproducible, copy-pasteable, and legally safe to reuse.
Style should reflect best practices for onboarding clarity, modularity, and reproducibility.
Output format:
Commit message first
Then code block with inline comments
No raw code dumps — every function and type should be annotated for clarity
