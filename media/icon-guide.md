# Kanri Extension Icon

## Design Choice: Japanese Kanji Character

The Kanri extension uses the Japanese kanji character **看** (kan) as its icon, which is the first character in **看板** (kanban).

### Cultural Significance

- **看板** (kanban) literally means "signboard" or "billboard" in Japanese
- **看** (kan) means "to look," "to see," or "to watch" 
- This character represents the visual nature of kanban boards
- Pays homage to the original Toyota Production System where kanban methodology originated

### Technical Specifications

- **Size**: 128x128 pixels
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Colors**: VS Code blue (#007ACC) with white text
- **Font**: Japanese system fonts (Hiragino Sans, Yu Gothic, etc.)
- **Background**: Rounded rectangle matching VS Code design language

### Design Rationale

1. **Cultural Authenticity**: Uses actual Japanese characters from kanban methodology
2. **Visual Recognition**: Single character is clear and readable at small sizes
3. **Professional Appearance**: Matches VS Code's design aesthetic
4. **Meaningful Symbol**: The "looking/seeing" meaning aligns with visual project management

### Icon Files

- `icon.png`: Final 128x128 PNG for VS Code marketplace
- `icon-simple.svg`: Source SVG with single kanji character
- `icon.svg`: Alternative SVG with full "看板" text

This design choice connects the extension to kanban's Japanese origins while providing a unique, culturally meaningful icon that stands out in the VS Code ecosystem.
